# Node.js Server with GraphQL and Redis

This project is a Node.js server using GraphQL for API interactions and Redis for caching. It also integrates with PostgreSQL for data storage and Prisma as the ORM. The project is containerized using Docker and includes a basic CI/CD pipeline set up with GitHub Actions.

## Technologies Used

- **Node.js**: Backend runtime for building server-side applications.
- **GraphQL**: API query language for requesting specific data.
- **Redis**: In-memory data store used for caching.
- **PostgreSQL**: Relational database for persistent data storage.
- **Prisma**: ORM (Object-Relational Mapper) to manage database interactions.
- **TypeScript**: Strongly typed JavaScript for safer development.
- **Docker**: Containerization tool used to package and run the application consistently across environments.
- **GitHub Actions**: CI/CD pipeline for automated testing and deployment.
- **Yarn**: Package manager for dependency management.
